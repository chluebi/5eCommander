                To initialise the bot on the guild, run (needs admin permissions):
                <div class="code">
                    /guild_init
                </div>
                Players can now join the game by running

                gives you an overview over your user. These are your <b>Resources</b> and your <b>Card Piles</b>.
                Resources are fungible resources:
                <ul>
                    <li>Orders: Used to play cards to regions, recharges slowly</li>
                    <li>Gold: Used for more powerful card abilities</li>
                    <li>Artefacts: Gained in dungeons and used for powerful region abilities.</li>
                    <li>Intel: Used to get Artefacts. Hard to get.</li>
                    <li>Magic: Used for rolling new creatures, recharges</li>
                    <li>Rally: Used for claiming rolled creatures, gained through campaigning</li>
                </ul>
                Your main card piles are the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hand: All the cards you can play or campaign, you slowly draw until your hand is full</li>
                    <li>Deck: Where you draw from, draws are random from your deck.</li>
                    <li>Played: Your creatures which are currently recharging after having been played. They go in your discard afterwards.</li>
                    <li>Discard: Collects all your formerly played and campaigned creatures. Gets reshuffled into your deck if your deck becomes empty and you need to draw.</li>
                    <li>Campaign: These are the creatures fighting for you in the conflict, many of them contributing in Strength. These only return to your discard when the conflict is over.</li>
                </ul>
                That's a lot! But it will make the actions we'll now discuss make more sense.
                The main two things you can do is <b>Play to a region</b> and <b>Campaign</b>.
                Use the following to play a card from your hand to a region:
                <div class="code">
                    /play [card] [region]
                </div>
                The main benefit you want to gain is the effect of the region, although some cards have their own effects.
                The most important rule is that only cards which match the Region Category (the emoji in front of their name) of the region can go there.
                You also need to pay 1 Order to play a card to a region, which means sometimes you may need to wait.
                Something which does not cost any Orders is <b>Campaigning</b>:
                <div class="code">
                    /campaign [card]
                </div>
                This plays a card to campaign for you in the current conflict. Many cards will give you Strength which is needed to win the conflict.
                Others may have more unique effects or can't campaign at all.

                On your way to fantasy world domination, you will want to summon new followers with Magic.
                <div class="code">
                    /roll
                </div>
                Will summon a new potential card to add to your deck. 
                You can see that each card rolled like this has a cost associated.
                This needs to be paid in Rally. If you can pay the cost, you may claim the card and it is added to your discard pile.

                </div>
